# OpenGTIN

OpenGTIN is an open-source alternative to the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) system provided by GS1. 
This project aims to provide a versatile and accessible solution for businesses and developers who require GTIN-like identifiers without the need for GS1 membership or associated costs.
